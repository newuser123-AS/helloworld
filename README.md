Just testing out repositories and projects and how github works

Hi Humans, and all reading this.
My name is Yoshinori Andy Shinohara, mid-20's learning about github to utilize for projects in the near future.
My goal is to self-teach myself a really solid understanding of frontend development prior to enrolling into a coding bootcamp.
On my free time I like to take walks around my neighborhood.
I also try to go workout 2-4times a week. 
I like all types of food and it's really hard for my to pinpoint a favorite food. It really depends on what I'm feeling that day and time.
